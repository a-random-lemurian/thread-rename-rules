# Renaming rules
Every day at a set time, a roll is held to rename the thread.

## Definitions
- **Thread name period**, **TNP**: the period between individual thread
  renames.
- **Thread name roll contest**, **TNRC**: gathering of all members to decide
  on the thread's new name via random dice roll.

## Rename roll
1. At the scheduled time, all members must be online and roll, in accordance with the specified rolling system.
   1. Members who are more than 90 minutes late shall be granted the ability to roll for the remainder of the TNP, and shall forfeit it at the beginning of the next TNRC.
1. When all members except those late have rolled, the person who won,  shall choose the next thread name.
   1. In the event of several members getting the same number, the members with the tie, shall conduct another roll amongst themselves to break the tie.
1. Rerolls may be authorized upon the agreement of 75% of the participants.

## Scheduling
1. The TNRC shall be scheduled with the timezones of all potential participants taken into account, alongside sleep schedules.
    1. If it is impossible to schedule the TNRC such as that everyone is always available, then the timezone of a majority of the participants shall be taken into account.
        - Example: Alice, Bob, and Carol have the timezone UTC+8, and Dan has the timezone UTC-8. The thread rename should be scheduled without regard to Dan. Dan is expected to alter their sleep schedule to partake in the thread rename.
        - Example 2: Alice, Bob have the timezone UTC+8, but Carol and Dan have the timezone UTC-8. However, Carol is always active during the night, effectively making their timezone UTC+8. Again, the thread rename will be scheduled without regard to Dan.

## Host
1. The **Host** shall have the authority to arbitrarily begin a TNRC and choose the rolling system.
    1. The participants shall be allowed to host a TNRC in the event that:
        - The host:
            - is incapacitated, such as by being hospitalized due to severe
              injury or the loss of internet either due to insufficient
              financial resources or technical issues if prolonged;
            - is excessively late, or based on their activity patterns, likely
              to be late again;
        - the participants agree to host with a 75% majority.

## Rolling system
- **Highest number dice roll**: All members roll a number from 1 to 100, and the highest roller wins.
- **Range roll**: All members suggest a name, and the names are each assigned a number or range of numbers. The designated roller then rolls a dice from the lowest to highest numbers and the thread is renamed according to the number.
    - Example: A thread will be renamed Jangala if it recieves 1, and Eochu Bres recieves 2, and the designated roller rolls the number 1.
